Week 2 Homework:Portfolio (Cody Mullen)

In this repository you will find a page dedicated to my work, a short "About Me" 
section, and how to contact me.


## Pages

Throughout my portfolio you will find a navigation bar at the top for an easy
way to click through my different available repositories, as well clicking my 
name in the upper left hand corner to reach my github account.

## Portfolio Page

On the portfolio page you will find a set of thumbnails linked to the projects
I have made. Simply click the images to be taken to a project of your choice.

## Contact Me

To get ahold of me, click the "Contact" tab on the top of the screen to be taken to a form where you may send me a message along with your contact information.
